## 1. Run multiple commands in one line
 
Did you know that you can run multiple commands in one line using the command prompt? This can save you time and keystrokes when you need to perform several actions in a row. All you need to do is separate the commands with the & symbol. For example, if you want to create a new folder and open it in File Explorer, you can type:

    md newfolder & start newfolder

This will create a new folder named "newfolder" in the current directory and open it in a new window. You can also use && instead of & to run the second command only if the first one succeeds.
  
## 2. Copy and paste text in command prompt
 
Copying and pasting text in command prompt can be tricky, especially if you are used to the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V shortcuts. However, there is a simple way to enable these shortcuts in command prompt. Just right-click on the title bar of the command prompt window and select Properties. Then, under the Options tab, check the boxes for "QuickEdit Mode" and "Enable Ctrl key shortcuts". Click OK to save the changes.

## 3. Encrypt files and folders using command prompt
 
If you want to protect your sensitive files and folders from unauthorized access, you can use command prompt to encrypt them using the cipher command. This command uses the Encrypting File System (EFS) feature of Windows to encrypt and decrypt files and folders on NTFS drives. To encrypt a file or folder, type:

    cipher /e filename

where filename is the name of the file or folder you want to encrypt. You can also use wildcards (\*) to encrypt multiple files or folders at once. For example:

    cipher /e *.docx

This will encrypt all Word documents in the current directory. To decrypt a file or folder, use the /d switch instead of /e. For example:

    cipher /d filename

Note that only you or someone with your encryption key can access the encrypted files or folders. If you lose your encryption key or forget your password, you may not be able to recover your data.
  
## 4. Create a Wi-Fi hotspot using command prompt
 
If you want to share your internet connection with other devices wirelessly, you can use command prompt to create a Wi-Fi hotspot on your Windows computer. This can be useful when you don't have access to a router or a public Wi-Fi network. To create a Wi-Fi hotspot, type:

    netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=networkname key=password

where networkname is the name of your Wi-Fi hotspot and password is the password for accessing it. Then, type:

    netsh wlan start hostednetwork

This will start broadcasting your Wi-Fi hotspot. To stop it, type:

    netsh wlan stop hostednetwork

You can also check the status of your Wi-Fi hotspot by typing:

    netsh wlan show hostednetwork

To share your internet connection with your Wi-Fi hotspot, go to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. Right-click on your internet connection and select Properties. Then, under the Sharing tab, check the box for "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" and select your Wi-Fi hotspot from the drop-down menu.
